<h2>poem</h2>
<p>No man is an island,
<br>
Entire of itself,
<br>
Every man is a piece of the continent,
<br>
A part of the main.
<br>
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
<br>
Europe is the less.
<br>
As well as if a promontory were.
<br>
As well as if a manor of thy friend’s
<br>
Or of thine own were:
<br>
Any man’s death diminishes me,
<br>
Because I am involved in mankind,
<br>
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
<br>
It tolls for thee.</p>
